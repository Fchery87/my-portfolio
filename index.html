    <hr>
    <p>My favorite thing about programming is I like the idea that I can create something that other people use, and enjoy and value. When I have a program that I wrote or helped write that is making money, being used by the company, clients, or more, it is a wonderful feeling.

    I also like the fact that I can solve complicated problems and make a computer do what would take hours, days or even years to do manually.
    I also love that I can create things from my imagination and see them come to life for others as well as for me.
    I enjoy the challenge, and exhilaration of solving a vastly complex problem, even if it was 2 hours trying to figure out what was wrong and realizing a ! was missing.</p>
